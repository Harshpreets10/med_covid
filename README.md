SARS COV 2 or generally known as COVID 19 or Corona Virus has been declared pandemic i.e. it has become a worldwide threat. To avoid increasing the impact the government had to impose a nationwide ‘self-imposed curfew’. We must know that just self-quarantining ourselves will not help overcome this disaster. We need to do more and more checkups to help contain the virus. Thus, we made an application that would provide the general public to get checked up from the professional team without compromising their safety by going out to the hospital.

Using our application people who have symptoms of the virus can immediately get medical attention and help contain the virus. We not only want to provide checkup services but also educate people on how to stay safe and what not to do if they think they are facing the symptoms through online conferences with professional doctors. Safety of people is our top most priority therefore the doctors who will be testing will be completely equipped with PPE(Personal Protective Equipment). By providing these services we aim to snip this disaster at the bud and raise humanity back again at its best.

## About Project

WHO WILL BE BENEFITED: 
This Application is meant for providing various medical facilities to the general public in the extreme conditions of the pandemic spread of the COVID-19. Healthcare has become the top priority for every single person in the country. While preventing themselves from getting infected the basic healthcare requirements need to be met.
At the time of this grave pandemic our app Pharma-19 will be very useful for the people who are in self quarantine (as imposed by the Govt. of India). People can get the benefit of getting checked up by professional doctors without compromising their safety i.e. at the comfort of their own house and many more such facilities which are necessary in such conditions.

BENEFITS:
•	Customers can have themselves tested for Covid-19 and many other medical problems remotely in this Quarantine where people are expected to follow Social Distancing to prevent the spread.

•	Supply of necessary medical equipment needed for personal sanitization and prevention from spread of infection will be made available to the quarantined citizens of the country on their doorstep enabling them to stay safe and meet their sanitization needs. 

•	Large premises that are difficult to be sanitized by ordinary citizens in such time can cause risk of infection even while staying quarantined. The application will provide the benefits of industrial standard sanitization for the ordinary citizens at low and affordable prices to ensure maximum benefits from the facilities.

•	In case of emergency, when urgent medical assistance is required by the citizens, the emergency medical helpline will turn out to be very effective. Rather than rushing to the hospitals in their own private vehicles which could also be contaminated in such conditions, citizens can use the helpline to contact the medical authorities nearby and avail all the necessary emergency medical services.

•	Due to the pandemic spread of COVID-19 hospitals and other medical facilities around the world are facing extreme times with a huge number of cases emerging every single day. In such conditions, availability of doctors all the time at premises has become a problem. People looking for medical assistance can use this service of online consultancy to get in touch with medical professionals with a single click of the button while staying safe at their homes and practicing the crucial principle of Social Distancing.

•	The price of the checkup for covid-19 as specified by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) is 4500. The payment can be done in the form of instalments/EMI if the checkup is being done for the whole family. 

IMPLEMENTATION: 
The main utility of this app as discussed above focuses on helping people in the time of catastrophe. We will be building our app on Android IDE which will be available to all Android users and IOS users.

Each user will have to create an account in order to avail the benefits provided to them for instance, low priced tests and medical services. Once signed in, the app will ask for location permission so that the location of the user can be tracked. This unit will be implemented using GOOGLE MAP. 

A list of services will be provided to choose from namely:

•	Medical Tests- This section of code helps the user to get medically tested at home with dexterity by a certified professional. This prevents them from leaving their homes and sitting in the long queues where there could be a high possibility of being contaminated. Moreover, the results generated would be provided to them through the app itself. 

•	Supply of medical equipment- At present, this medical equipment would include articles like sanitizers, masks, gloves etc. and would be delivered at the doorstep of consumers. The users can add articles they require to the cart and checkout.

•	Sanitization of premises- The users can also benefit from this app by using the sanitization assistance. We will be providing them the convenience of decontaminating their homes only with a click on their phones. Their respected premises will be sanitized by industrial professionals to ensure complete safety of them.

•	Emergency helplines- All emergency helplines will be available on our app so that the user does not waste any time to google it. 

•	Online Consultancy- Being quarantined in their homes makes it difficult for people to consult medical professionals. In current situations all the hospitals and medical facilities around the nation are under immense pressure and full of people suffering from the extremely dangerous Covid-19. In such situations the feature of Online Consultancy can prove to be really helpful. People in need can contact the medical professionals through the app and can get their professional advice in a secure way .

FUTURE SCOPE: 
The app, at present, focuses on helping people in isolation by providing various healthcare facilities along with a safe and secure helpline for contacting the medical authorities. 
The future scope of this application is vast. Later on, this will be an app which will focus on helping people with all medical issues at the convenience of their house (if possible) and also providing them with all medical equipment and pharmaceuticals possible. Not only will it focus on providing medical assistance to the needy, it will be expanded to form a platform for online sale of prescription drugs as well as medical equipment of all sorts. The project can expand to encompass various facilities of the medical sector to form an integrated platform for everyone.
